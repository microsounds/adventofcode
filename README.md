# Advent of Code puzzle solutions
This repo isn't that interesting unless you refer to http://adventofcode.com/ for the the challenge text.

## 2017
for C solutions, invoke `make`, most will accept a filename or `stdin` for input

`$ cat 'input.txt' | ./day01 -`
## 2016
invoke `make` to build all solutions at once
## 2015
`$ make && ./day01p1 input`
